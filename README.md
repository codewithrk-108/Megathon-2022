# E-Cell Megathon 2022

Our team was shortlisted for finals in the problem statement "Improving Rural healthcare through IT". We proposed the solution of a personalized chatbot solution in vernacular languages that can help in resolving the mild symptoms of the rural people. THis will not create a problem of lack of doctor facilities in those areas. While in similar manner, the persons with serious symptoms can get fast treatment without any large queues due to the IT based approach.
