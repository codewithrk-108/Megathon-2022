# E-Cell Megathon 2022

Our team was shortlisted for finals in the problem statement "Improving Rural healthcare through IT". We proposed the solution of a personalized chatbot solution in vernacular languages that can help in resolving the mild symptoms of the rural people. This will not create a problem of lack of doctor facilities in those areas. While in similar manner, the persons with serious symptoms can get fast treatment without any large queues due to the IT based approach. 

A unique addition to our Idea was to make a StackOverflow kind of system where if a previous patient experienced similar symptoms, the similar results are fetched from the database. This reduces the redundant load on doctors and mitigates problems faced like lack of medical consultants, doctors,etc. You can see the demo video to get the approach:).
